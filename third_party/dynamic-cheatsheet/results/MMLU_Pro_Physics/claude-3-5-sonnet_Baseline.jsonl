They occur in binary star systems where one star is a white dwarf and the other is typically a red giant or another white dwarf.\n\n2. The white dwarf accretes matter from its companion star until it reaches the Chandrasekhar limit (about 1.4 solar masses), triggering the supernova.\n\n3. Because this process always occurs at the same mass limit, type-Ia supernovae are remarkably consistent in their brightness, making them excellent \"standard candles\" for measuring cosmic distances.\n\nLooking at the options, option (A) states that \"This type occurs in binary systems,\" which is exactly correct. Type-Ia supernovae can only occur in binary systems, as a single white dwarf cannot trigger this type of explosion on its own.\n\nAll other options are either incorrect or not specifically characteristic of type-Ia supernovae.\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\n<answer>\n(A)\n</answer>"}
