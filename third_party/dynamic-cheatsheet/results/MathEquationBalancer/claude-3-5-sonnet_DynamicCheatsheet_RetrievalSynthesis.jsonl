Let's verify it manually:\n\n29 + 17 + 21 = 67\n- First operation: 29 + 17 = 46\n- Second operation: 46 + 21 = 67\n\nThis checks out perfectly. The equation works with addition operators in both positions.\n\nLet me now provide the final answer in the required format:\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\n<answer>\n29 + 17 + 21 = 67\n</answer>"], "final_answer": "26*24-11 = 613", "final_output": "Let me solve this step by step using the provided strategies and cheatsheet.\n\n1.

Let's use Python to systematically test combinations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expr = str(nums[0])\n    for i, op in enumerate(ops):\n        expr += op + str(nums[i + 1])\n    try:\n        result = eval(expr)\n        return result\n    except:\n        return None\n\ndef find_solution(nums, target):\n    operators = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    for ops in product(operators, repeat=len(nums)-1):\n        result = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n        if result == target:\n            return ops\n    return None\n\nnums = [29, 17, 21]\ntarget = 67\nsolution = find_solution(nums, target)\nif solution:\n    expr = str(nums[0])\n    for i, op in enumerate(solution):\n        expr += op + str(nums[i + 1])\n    print(f\"{expr} = {target}\")\n```\nEXECUTE CODE!\n\nOutput of the Python code above:\n```\n29+17+21 = 67\n```\n\nThe Python code has helped us find the solution. Let's verify it manually:\n\n29 + 17 + 21 = 67\n- First operation: 29 + 17 = 46\n- Second operation: 46 + 21 = 67\n\nThis checks out perfectly.

SOLUTION DEVELOPMENT:\nLet me use the provided code to verify possible combinations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expr = str(nums[0])\n    for i, op in enumerate(ops):\n        expr += op + str(nums[i + 1])\n    try:\n        result = eval(expr)\n        if isinstance(result, (int, float)) and result == int(result):\n            return int(result), expr\n        return None, expr\n    except:\n        return None, expr\n\ndef find_solution(nums, target):\n    operators = ['*', '+', '-', '/']  # All operators\n    for ops in product(operators, repeat=len(nums)-1):\n        result, expr = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n        if result == target:\n            return expr + f\" = {target}\"\n    return None\n\nnums = [6, 5, 2]\ntarget = 60\nsolution = find_solution(nums, target)\nprint(solution)\n```\nEXECUTE CODE!\n\nOutput of the Python code above:\n```\n6*5*2 = 60\n```\n\nThe code has already found the solution. Let me verify it manually:\n\n6 * 5 * 2 = 60\n- First operation: 6 * 5 = 30\n- Second operation: 30 * 2 = 60\n\nThis solution is correct because:\n1. It uses valid operators (+, -, *, /)\n2. The operators are placed in the correct sequence from left to right\n3. The final result equals the target number 60\n4. All intermediate calculations yield whole numbers\n5.

IMPLEMENTATION:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expr = str(nums[0])\n    for i, op in enumerate(ops):\n        expr += op + str(nums[i + 1])\n    try:\n        result = eval(expr)\n        if isinstance(result, (int, float)) and result == int(result):\n            return int(result), expr\n    except:\n        return None, expr\n    return None, expr\n\ndef find_solution(nums, target):\n    operators = ['+', '-', '*', '/']  # Prioritize addition/subtraction for medium-small targets\n    \n    for ops in product(operators, repeat=len(nums)-1):\n        result, expr = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n        if result == target:\n            return expr + f\" = {target}\"\n    return None\n\n# Test the equation\nnums = [4, 16, 27, 28, 7]\ntarget = 41\nsolution = find_solution(nums, target)\nprint(solution)\n```\nEXECUTE CODE!\n\nOutput of the Python code above:\n```\n4*16-27+28/7 = 41\n```\n\nLet me verify the solution found by the program:\n\n4 * 16 - 27 + 28 / 7 = 41\n\nLet's verify using PEMDAS:\n1. First, multiplication and division:\n   * 4 * 16 = 64\n   * 28 / 7 = 4\n2. Then addition and subtraction from left to right:\n   * 64 - 27 = 37\n   * 37 + 4 = 41\n\nThe solution checks out perfectly! The equation evaluates to exactly 41 using proper order of operations, and all intermediate steps produce valid integers.\n\nTherefore, I can now present the final answer:\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\n<answer>\n4 * 16 - 27 + 28 / 7 = 41\n</answer>", "final_cheatsheet": "Version: 90.0\n\n## Reusable Code Snippets and Solution Strategies\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nEnhanced Systematic Operator Testing Framework (Reference: Q1-Q99)\nOptimized Python implementation for handling 2-5 operands:\n- Uses itertools.product for efficient combination generation\n- Implements safe expression evaluation with error handling\n- Enhanced result validation for integers\n- Target-based operator prioritization:\n  * For small targets (< 50): Start with addition/subtraction combinations\n  * For large negative targets (< -100): Prioritize multiplication-subtraction combinations\n  * For medium targets (40-80): Test addition chains with strategic multiplication/division\n  * For targets smaller than operands: Focus on subtraction patterns\nLatest insights from Q93-Q99:\n  * When dealing with multiple large numbers (>15), consider division to reduce magnitude\n  * Look for clean division opportunities that result in whole numbers\n  * Strategic positioning of multiplication/division can help reach medium targets\n</description>\n<example>\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expr = str(nums[0])\n    for i, op in enumerate(ops):\n        expr += op + str(nums[i + 1])\n    try:\n        result = eval(expr)\n        if isinstance(result, (int, float)) and result == int(result):\n            return int(result), expr\n        return None, expr\n    except:\n        return None, expr\n\ndef find_solution(nums, target):\n    # Prioritize operators based on target characteristics\n    if target < 50:\n        operators = ['+', '-', '/', '*']  # Prioritize addition/subtraction for medium-small targets\n    elif target < -100:\n        operators = ['*', '-', '+', '/']  # Prioritize multiplication for large negative targets\n    else:\n        operators = ['+', '*', '-', '/']  # Standard priority\n    \n    for ops in product(operators, repeat=len(nums)-1):\n        result, expr = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n        if result == target:\n            return expr + f\" = {target}\"\n    return None\n```\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count: 99\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nMedium Target Strategy (Reference: Q95-Q99)\nSpecialized approach for targets between 40-80:\n1.

No multiplication/division operations to process\n2. Processing additions from left to right:\n   - 29 + 12 = 41\n   - 41 + 21 = 62\n3. Final result matches target exactly\n4.

Let me verify it manually using the PEMDAS Verification Framework from the cheatsheet:\n\n17 * 7 * 12 * 1 = 1428\n\nVerification:\n1. First multiplication: 17 * 7 = 119\n2. Second multiplication: 119 * 12 = 1428\n3. Final multiplication: 1428 * 1 = 1428\n\nThe solution is verified and correct.

Verify the operations:\n   * First operation: 22 * 8 = 176\n   * Second operation: 176 - 13 = 163\n\n2. Check if it matches all requirements:\n   * Uses only allowed operators (+, -, *, /)\n   * Follows correct order of operations\n   * Results in the target number 163\n   * All intermediate steps produce valid integers\n   * Final result matches exactly\n\n3. The solution 22 * 8 - 13 = 163 is correct because:\n   * Following PEMDAS, we first calculate 22 * 8 = 176\n   * Then 176 - 13 = 163\n   * This matches our target value exactly\n\nSince we have verified the solution is correct, I can now provide the final answer.\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\n<answer>\n22 * 8 - 13 = 163\n</answer>", "final_cheatsheet": "Version: 119.0\n\n## Reusable Code Snippets and Solution Strategies\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nEnhanced Systematic Operator Testing Framework (Reference: Q1-Q127)\nOptimized Python implementation with target-based operator prioritization:\n- Target Range Analysis:\n  * Very Large Negative Target (<-500): Prioritize multiplication-subtraction chains\n  * Very Large Positive Target (>500): Prioritize multiplication chains\n  * Medium-Large Target (\u00b1100-500): Focus on multiplication-addition/subtraction combinations\n  * Small Target (-100 to 100): Consider all operations with natural priority\nLatest optimization:\n  * For medium-large targets (100-1000):\n    - Look for balanced multiplication pairs\n    - Consider combinations of multiplication with addition/subtraction\n    - Check for patterns like: (a*b)+(c*d) or a*b*c\u00b1d\n</description>\n<example>\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expr = str(nums[0])\n    for i, op in enumerate(ops):\n        expr += op + str(nums[i + 1])\n    try:\n        result = eval(expr)\n        if isinstance(result, (int, float)) and result == int(result):\n            return int(result), expr\n    except:\n        return None, expr\n    return None, expr\n\ndef find_solution(nums, target):\n    # Enhanced operator prioritization based on target\n    if target < -500:\n        operators = ['*', '-', '+', '/']\n    elif target > 500:\n        operators = ['*', '+', '-', '/']\n    elif abs(target) < 100:\n        operators = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    else:\n        operators = ['*', '+', '-', '/']\n    \n    for ops in product(operators, repeat=len(nums)-1):\n        result, expr = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n        if result == target:\n            return expr + f\" = {target}\"\n    return None\n```\n</example>\n</memory_item>\n** Count: 128\n\n<memory_item>\n<description>\nTarget-Based Pattern Recognition (Reference: Q120-Q128)\nCommon patterns for different target ranges:\n- For targets 100-200:\n  * Look for multiplication of first two numbers if they're <20\n  * Check if result needs simple addition/subtraction with last number\n  * Consider patterns like: (a*b)+c or (a*b)-c\n- For targets >500:\n  * Prioritize multiplication chains\n  * Look for balanced multiplication pairs\n  * Consider (a*b)+(c*d) pattern\n</description>\n<example>\nAnalysis Steps:\n1.

Let's use Python to systematically test combinations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef evaluate_expression(nums, ops):\n    expr = str(nums[0])\n    for i, op in enumerate(ops):\n        expr += op + str(nums[i + 1])\n    try:\n        result = eval(expr)\n        return result\n    except:\n        return None\n\ndef find_solution(nums, target):\n    operators = ['+', '-', '*', '/']\n    for ops in product(operators, repeat=len(nums)-1):\n        result = evaluate_expression(nums, ops)\n        if result == target:\n            return ops\n    return None\n\nnums = [29, 17, 21]\ntarget = 67\nsolution = find_solution(nums, target)\nif solution:\n    expr = str(nums[0])\n    for i, op in enumerate(solution):\n        expr += op + str(nums[i + 1])\n    print(f\"{expr} = {target}\")\n```\nEXECUTE CODE!\n\nOutput of the Python code above:\n```\n29+17+21 = 67\n```\n\nThe Python code has helped us find the solution.
