Question: Has Boeing reported any materially important ongoing legal battles from FY2022?\nDocument Pages Context:\nPage 113:\nTable of Contents\nbased upon current information, that the outcome of any such legal proceeding, claim, or government dispute and investigation will not have a\nmaterial effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of\nrecorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible\nlosses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be\nmade.\nMultiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the March 10, 2019\naccident of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. During 2021, we entered into (i) a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice\nthat resolved the Department of Justice's previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX by the Federal\nAviation Administration (FAA) as well as (ii) a proposed settlement with plaintiffs in a shareholder derivative lawsuit that resulted in the Company\nreceiving $219 in the second quarter of 2022. In September 2022, we settled a previously disclosed investigation by the Securities and\nExchange Commission related to the 737 MAX accidents and consented to a civil penalty, which resulted in an earnings charge of $200 that was\npaid in October 2022. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, not covered by available insurance that we may incur as a result of\nany remaining pending lawsuits or other matters related to the accidents and the 737 MAX.\nDuring 2019, we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A. (Embraer) to establish joint ventures that included the commercial aircraft and\nservices operations of Embraer, of which we were expected to acquire an 80 percent ownership stake for $4,200, as well as a joint venture to\npromote and develop new markets for the C-390 Millennium. In 2020, we exercised our contractual right to terminate these agreements based\non Embraer's failure to meet certain required closing conditions. Embraer has disputed our right to terminate the agreements, and the dispute is\ncurrently in arbitration. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may result from the arbitration, which we currently expect to\nbe completed in late 2023 or early 2024.\nNote 22 - Segment and Revenue Information\nOur primary profitability measurements to review a segment's operating results are Earnings/(loss) from operations and operating margins. We\noperate in four reportable segments: BCA, BDS, BGS and BCC. All other activities fall within Unallocated items, eliminations and other. See\npage 58 for the Summary of Business Segment Data, which is an integral part of this note.\nBCA develops, produces and markets commercial jet aircraft principally to the commercial airline industry worldwide. Revenue on commercial\naircraft contracts is recognized at the point in time when an aircraft is completed and accepted by the customer.\nBDS engages in the research, development, production and modification of the following products and related services: manned and unmanned\nmilitary aircraft and weapons systems, surveillance and engagement, strategic defense and intelligence systems, satellite systems and space\nexploration. BDS revenue is generally recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred.\nBGS provides parts, maintenance, modifications, logistics support, training, data analytics and information-based services to commercial and\ngovernment customers worldwide. BGS segment revenue and costs include certain products and services provided to other segments. Revenue\non commercial spare parts contracts is recognized at the point in time when a spare part is delivered to the customer.

Question: What are major acquisitions that AMCOR has done in FY2023, FY2022 and FY2021?\nDocument Pages Context:\nPage 64:\nNote 5 Acquisitions and Divestitures\n-\nYear ended June 30, 2023\nAcquisitions\nOn August 1, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% equity interest in a Czech Republic company that operates a world-class\nflexible packaging manufacturing plant. The purchase consideration of $59 million included a deferred portion of $5 million that was paid in the\nfirst quarter of fiscal year 2024. The acquisition is part of the Company's Flexibles reportable segment and resulted in the recognition of acquired\nidentifiable net assets of $36 million and goodwill of $23 million. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The fair values of the identifiable\nnet assets acquired and goodwill are based on the Company's best estimate as of June 30, 2023.\nOn March 17, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% equity interest in a medical device packaging manufacturing site in\nShanghai, China. The purchase consideration of $60 million is subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The consideration includes\ncontingent consideration of $20 million, to be earned and paid in cash over the three years following the acquisition date, subject to meeting\ncertain performance targets. The acquisition is part of the Company's Flexibles reportable segment and resulted in the recognition of acquired\nidentifiable net assets of $21 million and goodwill of $39 million. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The fair values of the contingent\nconsideration, identifiable net assets acquired, and goodwill are based on the Company's best estimate as of June 30, 2023, and are considered\npreliminary. The Company aims to complete the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the date of the\nacquisition.\nOn May 31, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of a New Zealand based leading manufacturer of state-of-the-art, automated protein\npackaging machines. The purchase consideration of $45 million is subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The consideration includes\ncontingent consideration of $13 million, to be earned and paid in cash over the two years following the acquisition date, subject to meeting\ncertain performance targets. The acquisition is part of the Company's Flexibles reportable segment and resulted in the recognition of acquired\nidentifiable net assets of $9 million and goodwill of $36 million. Goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. The fair values of the contingent\nconsideration, identifiable net assets acquired, and goodwill are based on the Company's best estimate as of June 30, 2023, and are considered\npreliminary. The Company aims to complete the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the date of the\nacquisition.\nThe fair value estimates for all three acquisitions were based on income, market, and cost valuation methods. Pro forma information related to\nthese acquisitions has not been presented, as the effect of the acquisitions on the Company's consolidated financial statements was not material.\nDisposal of Russian business\nOn December 23, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its Russian business after receiving all necessary regulatory approvals and cash\nproceeds, including receipt of closing cash balances. The sale follows the Company's previously announced plan to pursue the orderly sale of its\nRussian business. The total net cash consideration received, excluding disposed cash and items settled net, was $365 million and resulted in a\npre-tax net gain of $215 million. The carrying value of the Russian business had previously been impaired by $90 million in the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2022. The impairment charge was based on the Company's best estimate of the fair value of its Russian business, which considered the\nwide range of indicative bids received and uncertain regulatory environment. The net pre-tax gain on disposal of the Russian business has been\nrecorded as restructuring, impairment, and other related activities, net within the consolidated statements of income. The Russian business had a\nnet carrying value of $252 million, including allocated goodwill of $46 million and accumulated other comprehensive losses of $73 million,\nprimarily attributed to foreign currency translation adjustments.\nYear ended June 30, 2022\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company completed the disposal of non-core assets in the Flexibles reporting segment.

Question: Did AMD report customer concentration in FY22?\nDocument Pages Context:\nPage 12:\nTable of Contents\nWe also work with our customers to create differentiated products that leverage our CPU, GPU and APU technology. Certain customers pay us non-recurring\nengineering fees for design and development services and a purchase price for the resulting products.\nOne customer accounted for 16% of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Sales to this customer consisted of sales of products\nfrom our Gaming segment. A loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturers\nWe focus on three types of OEM partners: multi-nationals, selected regional accounts and selected global and local system integrators, who target commercial\nand consumer end customers of all sizes. Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM partners' business; however, we are\nincreasingly focused on the VAR channel which resells OEM systems to the mid-market and the small and medium business (SMB) segments. Additionally, we\nhave increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with their software and services solutions into Enterprise, high\nperformance computing (HPC) and Cloud Service Provider Customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers\nand workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\nThird-Party Distributors\nOur authorized channel distributors resell to sub-distributors and OEMs, ODMs, and other customers. Typically, distributors handle a wide variety of products,\nand may include products from other manufacturers that compete with our products. Distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most\ninstances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide certain return rights with respect to any\nproduct that we have removed from our price book or otherwise subject to discontinuation. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain\nstandard stock rotation provisions permitting limited product returns.\nAdd-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\nWe offer component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-level products using our technology to system\nintegrators (SIs), retail buyers and sub distributors. Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We also sell\ndirectly to our SI customers. Sls typically sell from positions of regional or product-based strength in the market. They usually operate on short design cycles\nand can respond quickly with new technologies. Sls often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their\ncustomers.\nCompetition in Data Center Segment\nIn Data Center, we compete against Intel Corporation (Intel) with our FPGA, Adaptive SoC, CPU and DPU server products and NVIDIA Corporation (NVIDIA)\nwith our CPU, GPU and DPU server products. A variety of companies provide or have developed ARM-based microprocessors and platforms. ARM-based\ndesigns are being used in the server market, which could lead to further growth and development of the ARM ecosystem.\nCompetition in Client Segment\nThe markets in which we participate are highly competitive. Our primary competitor in the supply of CPUs is Intel. A variety of companies provide or have\ndeveloped ARM-based microprocessors and platforms. ARM-based designs are being used in the PC market, which could lead to further growth and\ndevelopment of the ARM ecosystem.\n9\n\nAnswer:", "target": "Yes, one customer accounted for 16% of consolidated net revenue", "url": "https://ir.amd.com/sec-filings/content/0000002488-23-000047/0000002488-23-000047.pdf", "pages": [12]}

These forward-\nlooking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from expectations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof or as of the dates indicated in the statements and should not\nbe relied upon as predictions of future events, as we cannot assure you that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will\noccur.

The forward-looking statements relate to, among other things: possible impact of future accounting rules on AMD's consolidated\nfinancial statements; demand for AMD's products; the growth, change and competitive landscape of the markets in which AMD participates; international sales\nwill continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future; that AMD's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances together\nwith the availability under that certain revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Agreement) made available to AMD and certain of its subsidiaries, our\ncommercial paper program, and our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund AMD's operations including capital expenditures and purchase\ncommitments over the next 12 months and beyond; AMD's ability to obtain sufficient external financing on favorable terms, or at all; AMD's expectation that\nbased on management's current knowledge, the potential liability related to AMD's current litigation will not have a material adverse effect on its financial\nposition, results of operation or cash flows; anticipated ongoing and increased costs related to enhancing and implementing information security controls; all\nunbilled accounts receivables are expected to be billed and collected within 12 months; revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations that are\nunsatisfied which will be recognized in the next 12 months; and a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of AMD's revenue in\nthe future.

Question: What drove revenue change as of the FY22 for AMD?\nDocument Pages Context:\nPage 43:\nTable of Contents\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 and for\neach of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the\nother sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, \"Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nIntroduction\nIn this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries\n(collectively, \"us,\" \"our\" or \"AMD\"), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021, an analysis of changes in our financial\ncondition and a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are\nnot included in this Form 10-K can be found in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 of\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021.\nOverview\n2022 was a transformative year for AMD as we took several major steps that scaled and reshaped our business. In February 2022, we completed our strategic\nacquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware\nacceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a\nsignificant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products.\nWith the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022,\nwe expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data\nprocessing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to\nprovide the industry's broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of\nownership for leading-edge data centers.\nOur 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net\nrevenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64%\nincrease in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYCTM server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue\nprimarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion\nof Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments\ndriven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022,\nwas 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.\nOperating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by\namortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The\ndecrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021. Our aggregate\nprincipal amount of total debt as of December 31, 2022 was $2.5 billion, compared to $313 million as of December 25, 2021.\nWe took several actions in 2022 to strengthen our financial position. In June 2022, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes,\nconsisting of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.924% Senior Notes due 2032 (3.924% Notes) and $500 million in aggregate principal amount of\n4.393% Senior Notes due 2052 (4.393% Notes). The 3.924% Notes will mature on June 1, 2032 and bear interest at a rate of 3.924% per annum, and the\n4.393% Notes will mature on June 1, 2052 and bear interest at a rate of 4.393% per annum.

{"context": "Answer the following question very briefly using scanned text from pages. No explanation needed. Question: What are major acquisitions that Best Buy has done in FY2023, FY2022 and FY2021?\nDocument Pages Context:\nPage 51:\nVendor Allowances\nWe receive funds from our merchandise vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, primarily in the form of purchases-based or sales-based\nvolumes and for product advertising and placement. We recognize allowances based on purchases and sales as a reduction of cost of sales when the associated\ninventory is sold. Allowances for advertising and placement are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales ratably over the corresponding performance period.\nFunds that are determined to be a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell a vendor's products are recorded as an offset to\nthe related expense within SG&A when incurred.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs, which are included in SG&A, are expensed the first time the advertisement runs. Advertising costs consist primarily of digital advertisements.\nAdvertising expenses were $864 million, $915 million and $819 million in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for the fair value of our stock-based compensation awards, which is determined based on the closing market\nprice of our stock at the date of grant for time-based and performance-based share awards, and Monte-Carlo simulation for market-based share awards.\nCompensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period in which services are required, except for performance-based share awards that\nvest on a graded basis, in which case the expense is front-loaded or recognized on a graded-attribution basis. Forfeitures are expensed as incurred or upon\ntermination.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) is computed as net earnings plus certain other items that are recorded directly to shareholders' equity.\n2. Acquisitions\nCurrent Health Ltd.\nIn fiscal 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Current Health Ltd. (\"Current Health\"), a care-at-home technology platform, on November 2, 2021, for\nnet cash consideration of $389 million. The acquired assets included $351 million of goodwill that was assigned to our Best Buy Health reporting unit and was\ndeductible for income tax purposes. The acquisition is aligned with our focus in virtual care to enable people in their homes to connect seamlessly with their\nhealth care providers and is included in our Domestic reportable segment and Services revenue category. The acquisition was accounted for using the\nacquisition method of accounting for business combinations and was not material to the results of operations.\nTwo Peaks, LLC d/b/a Yardbird Furniture\nIn fiscal 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Two Peaks, LLC d/b/a Yardbird Furniture (\"Yardbird\"), a direct-to-consumer outdoor furniture company,\non November 4, 2021, for net cash consideration of $79 million. The acquired assets included $47 million of goodwill that was assigned to our Best Buy Domestic\nreporting unit and was deductible for income tax purposes. The acquisition expands our assortment in categories like outdoor living, as more and more\nconsumers look to make over or upgrade their outdoor living spaces. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting for business\ncombinations and was not material to the results of our operations.\n3.

Charges incurred relate to employee termination benefits within our Domestic and\nInternational segments of $140 million and $5 million, respectively. We currently do not expect the remaining charges in fiscal 2024 related to this initiative to be\nmaterial to the results of our operations.\nAll charges incurred related to this initiative were from continuing operations and were presented within Restructuring charges on our Consolidated Statements of\nEarnings.\n51\n\nAnswer:", "target": "Best Buy closed two acquisitions, both these companies were already partially owned by Best Buy, but Best Buy acquired all outstanding shares of these two companies during FY 2022: (1) Current Health Ltd and (2) Two Peaks, LLC d/b/a Yardbird Furniture", "url": "https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000764478/a7d1c855-4d22-48e4-9d17-b5f5af923dbe.pdf", "pages": [51]}
{"context": "Answer the following question very briefly using scanned text from pages. No explanation needed. Question: Has CVS Health reported any materially important ongoing legal battles from 2022, 2021 and 2020?\nDocument Pages Context:\nPage 173:\nto be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved\nfor several years. The Company also may be named from time to time in qui tam actions initiated by private third parties that could also be separately pursued\nby a governmental body. The results of legal proceedings, including government investigations, are often uncertain and difficult to predict, and the costs\nincurred in these matters can be substantial, regardless of the outcome.\nThe Company records accruals for outstanding legal matters when it believes it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal matters that could affect the amount of any accrual and developments that\nwould make a loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. If a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company\ndoes not establish an accrued liability. None of the Company's accruals for outstanding legal matters are material individually or in the aggregate to the\nCompany's financial condition.\nExcept as otherwise noted, the Company cannot predict with certainty the timing or outcome of the legal matters described below, and the Company is unable\nto reasonably estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of amounts already accrued for these matters. The Company believes that its defenses\nand assertions in pending legal proceedings have merit and does not believe that any of these pending matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and\nrights to indemnification, will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. Substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings,\nhowever, do sometimes occur, which could result in judgments against the Company, entry into settlements or a revision to its expectations regarding the\noutcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations. In addition, as a result of governmental\ninvestigations or proceedings, the Company may be subject to damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions including possible suspension or\nloss of licensure and/or exclusion from participating in government programs. The outcome of such governmental investigations of proceedings could be\nmaterial to the Company.\nUsual and Customary Pricing Litigation\nThe Company and certain current and former directors and officers are named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits that allege that the Company's retail\npharmacies overcharged for prescription drugs by not submitting the correct usual and customary price during the claims adjudication process. These actions\nare brought by a number of different types of plaintiffs, including plan members, private payors, government payors, and shareholders based on different legal\ntheories. Some of these cases are brought as putative class actions, and in some instances, classes have been certified. In October 2022, one of the litigating\nshareholders made a litigation demand to the Board related to these and other issues after his amended derivative complaint was dismissed for failing to\ndemonstrate demand futility. The Company is defending itself against these claims.\nPBM Litigation and Investigations\nThe Company is named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and is subject to a number of investigations concerning its PBM practices.\nThe Company is facing multiple lawsuits, including by state Attorneys General, governmental subdivisions and several putative class actions, regarding drug\npricing and its rebate arrangements with drug manufacturers. These complaints, brought by a number of different types of plaintiffs under a variety of legal\ntheories, generally allege that rebate agreements between the drug manufacturers and PBMs caused inflated prices for certain drug products. The Company is\ndefending itself against these claims. The Company has also received subpoenas, civil investigative demands (\"CIDs\"), and other requests for documents and\ninformation from, and is being investigated by, the FTC and Attorneys General of several states and the District of Columbia regarding its PBM practices,\nincluding pricing and rebates. The Company has been providing documents and information in response to these subpoenas, CIDs, and requests for\ninformation.\nUnited States ex rel. Behnke v. CVS Caremark Corporation, et al. (U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania). In April 2018, the Court\nunsealed a complaint filed in February 2014. The government has declined to intervene in this case. The relator alleges that the Company submitted, or caused\nto be submitted, to Part D of the Medicare program Prescription Drug Event data and/or Direct and Indirect Remuneration reports that misrepresented true\nprices paid by the Company's PBM to pharmacies for drugs dispensed to Part D beneficiaries with prescription benefits administered by the Company's PBM.\nThe Company is defending itself against these claims.\n171\n\nPage 174:\nControlled Substances Litigation, Audits and Subpoenas\nIn December 2017, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases filed against various defendants by plaintiffs such as\ncounties, cities, hospitals, Indian tribes and third-party payors, alleging claims beginning as far back as the early 2000s generally concerning the impacts of\nwidespread prescription opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation captioned In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) is\npending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. This multidistrict litigation presumptively includes hundreds of relevant federal court cases\nthat name the Company as a defendant. A significant number of similar cases that name the Company as a defendant in some capacity are pending in state\ncourts.\nIn addition, the Company has been named as a defendant in similar cases brought by certain state Attorneys General. The Company is defending itself against\nall such claims. Additionally, the Company has received subpoenas, CIDs, and/or other requests for information regarding opioids from state Attorneys General\nand insurance and other regulators of several U.S. jurisdictions. The Company has been cooperating with the government with respect to these subpoenas,\nCIDS, and other requests for information.\nIn November 2021, the Company was among the chain pharmacies found liable by a jury in a trial in federal court in Ohio; in August 2022, the court issued a\njudgment jointly against the three defendants in the amount of $651 million to be paid over 15 years, and also ordered certain injunctive relief. The Company is\nappealing the judgment and has not accrued a liability for this matter. In March 2022, CVS Health Corporation and CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into a\nsettlement agreement with the State of Florida to resolve claims related to opioid medications dating back more than a decade. Under the terms of the\nsettlement agreement, CVS Health Corporation settled all opioid claims against it and its subsidiaries by the State of Florida for $484 million, which is to be\npaid over a period of 18 years. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company recorded a $484 million liability associated with this legal\nsettlement. In August 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the State of New Mexico to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents\nand subsidiaries by the State of New Mexico and participating subdivisions. In September 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the State\nof West Virginia to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents and subsidiaries by the State of West Virginia and participating subdivisions. Also in\nSeptember 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the Cherokee Nation to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents and subsidiaries\nby the Cherokee Nation.\nIn December 2022, the Company agreed to a formal settlement agreement, the financial amounts of which were agreed to in principle in October 2022, with a\nleadership group of a number of state Attorneys General and the Plaintiffs' Executive Committee (\u201cPEC\u201d). The agreement would resolve substantially all\nopioid claims against Company entities by states and political subdivisions, but not private plaintiffs. The maximum amount payable by the Company under the\nsettlement would be approximately $4.3 billion in opioid remediation and $625 million in attorneys' fees and costs and additional remediation. The amounts\nwould be payable over 10 years, beginning in 2023. The agreement also contains injunctive terms relating to the dispensing of opioid medications. The\nsettlement agreement is available at nationalopioidsettlement.com.\nUnder the settlement agreement, before the Company determines whether to enter into any final settlement, it will assess the number and identities of the\ngovernmental entities that will participate in any such settlement. The settlement agreement contemplates that if certain governmental entities do not agree to\nthe settlement, but the Company nonetheless concludes that there is sufficient participation to warrant going forward with the settlement, there would be a\ncorresponding reduction in the amount due from the Company to account for the governmental entities that did not agree. Those non-participating\ngovernmental entities would be entitled to pursue their claims against the Company and other defendants. Private plaintiff litigation will also continue.\nThe Company has been informed that 45 states, the District of Columbia, and all eligible United States territories have elected to join the settlement. Three\nstates were the subject of earlier settlements. The Company has elected to proceed with the settlement process based on that level of participation. The\nsettlement process will progress to the period during which subdivisions may elect to join.\nIn December 2022, the Company also agreed to a formal settlement agreement with a leadership group representing tribes throughout the United States. The\nagreement would resolve substantially all opioid claims against Company entities by such tribes. The maximum amount payable by the Company under the\nsettlement would be $113 million in opioid remediation and $18 million in attorneys' fees and costs. The amounts would be payable over 10 years, beginning\nin 2023. The agreement is contingent upon sufficient participation by tribes.\n172\n\nAnswer:", "target": "Yes, CVS Health has been involved in multiple ongoing legal battles.

As such, the forecasted annual income tax charge on the U.S. non-GAAP adjustments is calculated using the statutory tax rate of\n24.5%. There is no forecasted annual income tax benefit for Mexico non-GAAP items, as there is no forecasted annual tax expense on the income in the calculation of GAAP income tax expense.\nOur non-GAAP operating income rates decreased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to unfavorable SG&A rates, partially\noffset by favorable gross profit rates.\nOur non-GAAP effective tax rate increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the prior year resolution of certain discrete tax matters. Our non-\nGAAP effective tax rate increased in the first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the prior year resolution of certain discrete tax matters and decreased tax\nbenefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by the impact of lower pre-tax earnings.\nOur non-GAAP diluted EPS decreased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the decreases in non-GAAP operating income.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe closely manage our liquidity and capital resources. Our liquidity requirements depend on key variables, including the level of investment required to support\nour business strategies, the performance of our business, capital expenditures, dividends, credit facilities, short-term borrowing arrangements and working capital\nmanagement. We modify our approach to managing these variables as changes in our operating environment arise. For example, capital expenditures and share\nrepurchases are a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy, which, to a large extent, we can adjust in response to economic and other\nchanges in our business environment. We have a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which focuses on investing in key priorities that support our strategy.\nCash and cash equivalents were as follows ($ in millions):\nCash and cash equivalents\nJuly 29, 2023\nJanuary 28, 2023\nJuly 30, 2022\n$\n1,093\n$\n1,874 $\n840\nThe decrease in cash and cash equivalents from January 28, 2023, was primarily due to the timing and volume of inventory purchases and payments, dividend\npayments and capital expenditures, partially offset by earnings.\n20\n\nAnswer:", "target": "Yes, there was a decline of ~42% between FY2023 and Q2 of FY 2024.", "url": "https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000764478/5e179976-086d-4c3c-af0c-85fda4b35b9d.pdf", "pages": [20]}

{"context": "Answer the following question very briefly using scanned text from pages. No explanation needed. Question: What are three main companies acquired by Pfizer mentioned in this 10K report?\nDocument Pages Context:\nPage 70:\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nWe regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the unrecognized tax benefit: (i) if there are changes in tax law, analogous case law or there is new information that\nsufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to \"more likely than not\"; (ii) if the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) if there is a completion of an\naudit resulting in a favorable settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when we expect to pay cash\nwithin the next 12 months. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income and are classified on our consolidated balance sheet with the related\ntax liability.\nOur assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax\nbenefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the\nstatutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution.\nR. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nThe majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have both IRC-qualified and supplemental\n(non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for retirees and their eligible\ndependents. We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of each of our defined benefit plans as an asset or liability. The obligations are generally measured at the actuarial\npresent value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. Our pension and other postretirement obligations may be\ndetermined using assumptions such as discount rate, expected annual rate of return on plan assets, expected employee turnover and participant mortality. For our pension plans, the\nobligation may also include assumptions as to future compensation levels. For our other postretirement benefit plans, the obligation may include assumptions as to the expected cost\nof providing medical insurance benefits, as well as the extent to which those costs are shared with the employee or others (such as governmental programs). Plan assets are\nmeasured at fair value. Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs other than the service costs are recognized in Other (income)/deductions-net.\nS. Legal and Environmental Contingencies\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other product-related\nlitigation, commercial litigation, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications. In assessing contingencies related to legal\nand environmental proceedings that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that are probable of being asserted, we record accruals for these contingencies to the\nextent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. If some amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the\nrange, we accrue that amount. Alternatively, when no amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the lowest amount in the range.\nWe record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when recovery is assured.\nT. Share-Based Payments\nOur compensation programs can include share-based payments. Generally, grants under share-based payment programs are accounted for at fair value and these fair values are\ngenerally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting terms with the related costs recorded in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research\nand development expenses, as appropriate.\nNote 2. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments, Licensing Arrangements and Collaborative Arrangements\nA. Acquisitions\nTrillium\nOn November 17, 2021, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock not already owned by Pfizer of Trillium, a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developing\ntherapies targeting cancer immune evasion pathways and specific cell targeting approaches, for a price of $18.50 per share in cash, for total consideration of $2.0 billion, net of cash\nacquired. As a result, Trillium became our wholly owned subsidiary. We previously held a 2% ownership investment in Trillium. Trillium's lead program, TTI-622, is an investigational\nfusion protein that is designed to block the inhibitory activity of CD47, a molecule that is overexpressed by a wide variety of tumors.\nWe accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, TTI-622, represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired, which exclude cash\nacquired. At the acquisition date, we recorded a $2.1 billion charge representing an acquired IPR&D asset with no alternative future use in Research and development expenses, of\nwhich the $2.0 billion net cash consideration is presented as a cash outflow from operating activities. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $256 million of assets acquired\nprimarily consisting of cash and investments. Liabilities assumed were approximately $81 million.\nArray\nOn July 30, 2019, we acquired Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted small molecule\nmedicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need, for $48 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.2 billion ($10.9 billion, net of\ncash acquired). In addition, $157 million in payments to Array employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options was recognized as post-closing compensation expense\nand recorded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3). We financed the majority of the transaction with debt and the balance with existing cash.\nPfizer Inc.\n2021 Form 10-K\n64\n\nPage 71:\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nArray's portfolio includes Braftovi (encorafenib) and Mektovi (binimetinib), a broad pipeline of targeted cancer medicines in different stages of R&D, as well as a portfolio of out-\nlicensed medicines, which may generate milestones and royalties over time.\nThe final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed was completed in 2020. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded: (i) $6.3\nbillion in Identifiable intangible assets, consisting of $2.0 billion of Developed technology rights with a useful life of 16 years, $2.8 billion of IPR&D and $1.5 billion of Licensing\nagreements and other ($1.2 billion for technology in development--indefinite-lived licensing agreements and $360 million for developed technology-finite-lived licensing agreements\nwith a useful life of 10 years), (ii) $6.1 billion of Goodwill, (iii) $1.1 billion of net deferred tax liabilities and (iv) $451 million of assumed long-term debt, which was paid in full in 2019.\nIn 2020, we recorded measurement period adjustments to the estimated fair values initially recorded in 2019, which resulted in a reduction in Identifiable intangible assets of\napproximately $900 million with a corresponding change to Goodwill and net deferred tax liabilities. The measurement period adjustments were recorded to better reflect market\nparticipant assumptions about facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date and did not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of income for the year\nended December 31, 2020.\nTherachon\nOn July 1, 2019, we acquired all the remaining shares of Therachon, a privately-held clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on rare diseases, with assets in development for\nthe treatment of achondroplasia, a genetic condition and the most common form of short-limb dwarfism, for $340 million upfront, plus potential milestone payments of up to $470\nmillion contingent on the achievement of key milestones in the development and commercialization of the lead asset. We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since\nthe lead asset represented substantially all the fair value of the gross assets acquired. The total fair value of the consideration transferred for Therachon was $322 million, which\nconsisted of $317 million of cash and our previous $5 million investment in Therachon. In connection with this asset acquisition, we recorded a charge of $337 million in Research and\ndevelopment expenses.\nB. Divestitures\nMeridian\nOn December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary for approximately $51 million in cash and recognized a loss of approximately $167 million, net of tax, in\nDiscontinued operations-net of tax. In connection with the sale, Pfizer and the purchaser of Meridian entered into various agreements to provide a framework for our relationship\nafter the sale, including interim TSAs and a manufacturing supply agreement (MSA). The TSAs primarily involve Pfizer providing services related to information technology, among\nother activities, and are generally expected to be for terms of no more than 12 to 18 months post sale. The MSA is for a term of three years post sale with a two year extension period.\nNo amounts were recorded under the above arrangements in 2021.\nUpjohn Separation and Combination with Mylan\nOn November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and the combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan (the Transactions) to form Viatris.\nThe Transactions were structured as an all-stock, Reverse Morris Trust transaction. Specifically, (i) we contributed the Upjohn Business to a wholly owned subsidiary, which was\nrenamed Viatris, so that the Upjohn Business was separated from the remainder of our business (the Separation), (ii) following the Separation, we distributed, on a pro rata basis, all\nof the shares of Viatris common stock held by Pfizer to Pfizer stockholders as of the November 13, 2020 record date, such that each Pfizer stockholder as of the record date received\napproximately 0.124079 shares of Viatris common stock per share of Pfizer common stock (the Distribution); and (iii) immediately after the Distribution, the Upjohn Business combined\nwith Mylan in a series of transactions in which Mylan shareholders received one share of Viatris common stock for each Mylan ordinary share held by such shareholder, subject to any\napplicable withholding taxes (the Combination). Prior to the Distribution, Viatris made a cash payment to Pfizer equal to $12.0 billion as partial consideration for the contribution of the\nUpjohn Business to Viatris. As of the closing of the Combination, Pfizer stockholders owned approximately 57% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, and Mylan\nshareholders owned approximately 43% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, in each case on a fully diluted, as-converted and as-exercised basis. The Transactions are\ngenerally expected to be tax free to Pfizer and Pfizer stockholders for U.S. tax purposes. Beginning November 16, 2020, Viatris operates both the Upjohn Business and Mylan as an\nindependent publicly traded company, which is traded under the symbol \"VTRS\" on the NASDAQ.\nIn connection with the Transactions, in June 2020, Upjohn Inc. and Upjohn Finance B.V. completed privately placed debt offerings of $7.45 billion and \u20ac3.60 billion aggregate principal\namounts, respectively, (approximately $11.4 billion) of senior unsecured notes and entered into other financing arrangements, including a $600 million delayed draw term loan\nagreement and a revolving credit facility agreement for up to $4.0 billion. Proceeds from the debt offerings and other financing arrangements were used to fund the $12.0 billion cash\ndistribution Viatris made to Pfizer prior to the Distribution. We used the cash distribution proceeds to pay down commercial paper borrowings and redeem the $1.15 billion aggregate\nprincipal amount outstanding of our 1.95% senior unsecured notes that were due in June 2021 and $342 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 5.80% senior\nunsecured notes that were due in August 2023, before the maturity date. Interest expense for the $11.4 billion in debt securities incurred during 2020 is included in Discontinued\noperations-net of tax. Following the Separation and Combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan, we are no longer the obligor or guarantor of any Upjohn debt or Upjohn\nfinancing arrangements.\nAs a result of the spin-off of the Upjohn Business, we distributed net assets of $1.6 billion as of November 16, 2020, which was reflected as a reduction to Retained earnings and\nreflects the change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2021 to MTM Accounting. See Note 1C. Of this amount, $412 million represents cash transferred to the Upjohn\nBusiness, with the remainder considered a non-cash activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020. The spin-off also resulted in a net\nincrease to Accumulated other comprehensive loss of $423 million for the derecognition of net gains on foreign currency translation adjustments of $397 million and prior service net\ncredits associated with benefit plans of $26 million, which were reclassified to Retained earnings.\nAs a result of the separation of Upjohn, we incurred separation-related costs of $434 million in 2020 and $83 million in 2019, which are included in Discontinued operations-net of\ntax. These costs primarily relate to professional fees for regulatory filings and separation activities within finance, tax, legal and information system functions as well as investment\nbanking fees.\nPfizer Inc.\n2021 Form 10-K\n65\n\nAnswer:", "target": "Trillium, Array, and Therachon", "url": "https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000078003/fa35a206-5bac-4a7a-9571-1e194b4436b5.pdf", "pages": [70, 71]}
