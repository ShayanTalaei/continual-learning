Question: From FY21 to FY22, excluding Embedded, in which AMD reporting segment did sales proportionally increase the most?\nDocument Pages Context:\nPage 48:\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, we changed our reporting segments to align our financial reporting with how we manage our business in strategic\nend markets. This is consistent with how our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) assesses our financial performance and allocates resources. As a result,\nwe report our financial performance based on the following four reportable segments: Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded.\nAdditional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 4 \u2013 Segment Reporting of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form\n10-K).\nOur operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the\nyear, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends.\nThe following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2022 and 2021:\nNet revenue:\nData Center\nClient\nGaming\nEmbedded\nTotal net revenue\nOperating income (loss):\nData Center\nClient\nGaming\nEmbedded\nAll Other\nTotal operating income (loss)\nData Center\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022\nDecember 25,\n2021\n(In millions)\n$\n6,043 $\n3,694\n6,201\n6,887\n6,805\n5,607\n4,552\n246\nEA\n$\n23,601\n$\n16,434\nEA\n$\n1,848\n$\n991\n1,190\n2,088\n953\n934\n2,252\n44\n(4,979)\n(409)\n$\n1,264\n$\n3,648\nData Center net revenue of $6 billion in 2022 increased by 64%, compared to net revenue of $3.7 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher\nsales of our EPYC server processors.\nData Center operating income was $1.8 billion in 2022, compared to operating income of $991 million in 2021. The increase in operating income was primarily\ndriven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under \u201cExpenses\" below.\nClient\nClient net revenue of $6.2 billion in 2022 decreased by 10%, compared to net revenue of $6.9 billion in 2021, primarily driven by a 24% decrease in unit\nshipment, partially offset by a 19% increase in average selling price. The decrease in unit shipments was due to challenging PC market conditions and\nsignificant inventory correction across the PC supply chain experienced during the second half of 2022. The increase in average selling price was primarily\ndriven by a richer mix of Ryzen mobile processor sales.\nClient operating income was $1.2 billion in 2022, compared to operating income of $2.1 billion in 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven\nby lower revenue and higher operating expenses.

{"context": "Answer the following question very briefly using scanned text from pages. No explanation needed. Question: Among all of the derivative instruments that Verizon used to manage the exposure to fluctuations of foreign currencies exchange rates or interest rates, which one had the highest notional value in FY 2021?\nDocument Pages Context:\nPage 85:\nCertain of our equity investments do not have readily determinable fair values and are excluded from the tables above. Such investments are\nmeasured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical\nor similar investment of the same issuer and are included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated balance sheets. As\nof December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the carrying amount of our investments without readily determinable fair values were\n$808 million and $402 million, respectively. During 2021, there were approximately $66 million of adjustments due to observable price\nchanges and insignificant impairment charges. Cumulative adjustments due to observable price changes and impairment charges were\napproximately $143 million and $63 million, respectively.\nVerizon has a liability for contingent consideration related to its acquisition of Tracfone, completed in November 2021. The fair value is\ncalculated using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model and represents a Level 3 measurement. Level 3 instruments include\nvaluation based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other\nmarket participants. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting date, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured to fair\nvalue with changes recorded within Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.\nFixed income securities consist primarily of investments in municipal bonds. The valuation of the fixed income securities are based on the\nquoted prices for similar assets in active markets or identical assets in inactive markets or models that apply inputs from observable market\ndata. The valuation determines that these securities are classified as Level 2.\nDerivative contracts are valued using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substantial terms of our derivative\ncontracts and thus are classified within Level 2. We use mid-market pricing for fair value measurements of our derivative instruments. Our\nderivative instruments are recorded on a gross basis.\nWe recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period.\nFair Value of Short-term and Long-term Debt\nThe fair value of our debt is determined using various methods, including quoted prices for identical debt instruments, which is a Level 1\nmeasurement, as well as quoted prices for similar debt instruments with comparable terms and maturities, which is a Level 2 measurement.\nThe fair value of our short-term and long-term debt, excluding finance leases, was as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\nAt December 31, 2020\nAt December 31, 2021\nDerivative Instruments\nFair Value\nCarrying\nAmount\nLevel 1\n$\n127,778 $\n149,543\n103,967\n$\n106,599\nLevel 2\n52,785 $\n62,606\nLevel 3\nTotal\n$\n156,752\n169,205\nWe enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nWe employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including interest rate swaps, cross currency\nswaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, interest rate caps, swaptions and foreign exchange forwards.

Question: How much has the effective tax rate of Corning changed between FY2021 and FY2022?\nDocument Pages Context:\nPage 24:\nTable of Contents\n2022 Results\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $14.2 billion, a net increase of $107 million, or 1%, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This is\ndriven by 15% growth in segment net sales in Optical Communications of $674 million and 34% growth in Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses of $419 million,\nwhich helped offset a $394 million decrease in Display Technologies. In addition, movements in foreign exchange rates adversely impacted Corning's consolidated net\nsales by $616 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the same period in 2021.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated net income attributable to Corning Incorporated of $1,316 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, compared to net\nincome attributable to Corning Incorporated of $1,906 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2021. When compared to 2021, the $590\nmillion decrease was primarily driven by a $238 million increase in severance, accelerated depreciation, asset write-offs and other related charges, a $50 million increase\nin litigation, regulatory and other legal matters and a $120 million adverse impact from foreign currency translation.\nDiluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by $0.26 per diluted share, or 20%, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021,\nprimarily driven by the immediate repurchase and retirement of 35 million common shares which resulted in an $803 million one-time reduction to net income available\nto common shareholders in 2021, partially offset by the decrease in net income attributable to Corning Incorporated as described above. Refer to Note 16 (Shareholders'\nEquity) and Note 17 (Earnings per Common Share) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n2023 Corporate Outlook\nFor the first quarter 2023, we anticipate core sales in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents selected highlights from our operations (in millions):\nYear ended December 31,\n2022\n% change\n2021\n22 vs. 21\nNet sales\n$\n14,189\n$\n14,082\n1%\nGross margin\n$\n4,506\n$\n5,063\n(11%)\n(gross margin %)\n32%\n36%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n1,898\n$\n1,827\n4%\n(as a % of net sales)\n13%\n13%\nResearch, development and engineering expenses\n$\n1,047\n$\n995\n5%\n(as a % of net sales)\n7%\n7%\nTranslated earnings contract gain, net\n$\n351\n$\n354\n(1%)\n(as a % of net sales)\n2%\n3%\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n1,797\n$\n2,426\n(26%)\n(as a % of net sales)\nProvision for income taxes\nEffective tax rate\nNet income attributable to Corning Incorporated\n(as a % of net sales)\nComprehensive income attributable to Corning Incorporated\n13%\n17%\n$\n(411)\n$\n(491)\n16%\n23%\n20%\n$\n1,316\n$\n1,906\n(31%)\n9%\n14%\n661\n$\n1,471\n(55%)\n24\n24\n\nAnswer:", "target": "The effective tax rate of Corning has changed from 20% in FY2021 to 23% in FY 2022.", "url": "https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000024741/eb24002c-e050-45eb-806a-15264d59131c.pdf", "pages": [24]}

If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.\nDocument Pages Context:\nPage 43:\nTable of Contents\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 and for\neach of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the\nother sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, \"Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nIntroduction\nIn this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries\n(collectively, \"us,\" \"our\" or \"AMD\"), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021, an analysis of changes in our financial\ncondition and a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are\nnot included in this Form 10-K can be found in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 of\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021.\nOverview\n2022 was a transformative year for AMD as we took several major steps that scaled and reshaped our business. In February 2022, we completed our strategic\nacquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware\nacceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a\nsignificant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products.\nWith the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022,\nwe expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data\nprocessing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to\nprovide the industry's broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of\nownership for leading-edge data centers.\nOur 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net\nrevenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64%\nincrease in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYCTM server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue\nprimarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion\nof Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments\ndriven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022,\nwas 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.\nOperating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by\namortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The\ndecrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021. Our aggregate\nprincipal amount of total debt as of December 31, 2022 was $2.5 billion, compared to $313 million as of December 25, 2021.\nWe took several actions in 2022 to strengthen our financial position. In June 2022, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes,\nconsisting of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.924% Senior Notes due 2032 (3.924% Notes) and $500 million in aggregate principal amount of\n4.393% Senior Notes due 2052 (4.393% Notes). The 3.924% Notes will mature on June 1, 2032 and bear interest at a rate of 3.924% per annum, and the\n4.393% Notes will mature on June 1, 2052 and bear interest at a rate of 4.393% per annum. The 3.924% Notes and the 4.393% Notes are senior unsecured\nobligations.\n40\n\nAnswer:", "target": "The decrease in AMD's operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition", "url": "https://ir.amd.com/sec-filings/content/0000002488-23-000047/0000002488-23-000047.pdf", "pages": [43]}

{"context": "Answer the following question very briefly using scanned text from pages. No explanation needed. Question: Which Best Buy product category performed the best (by top line) in the domestic (USA) Market during Q2 of FY2024?\nDocument Pages Context:\nPage 18:\nTable of Contents\nNotable comparable sales changes by revenue category were as follows:\n\u2022\nComputing and Mobile Phones: The 6.4% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by computing, mobile phones and tablets.\nConsumer Electronics: The 5.7% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by home theater, partially offset by comparable sales growth in\nheadphones and portable speakers.\nAppliances: The 16.1% comparable sales decline was driven primarily by large appliances.\nEntertainment: The 9.0% comparable sales growth was driven primarily by gaming, partially offset by comparable sales declines in virtual reality and\ndrones.\nServices: The 7.6% comparable sales growth was driven primarily by the cumulative growth in our paid membership base.\nOur gross profit rate increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to favorable product margin rates, improved financial performance from our\nmembership offerings, which included higher services margin rates and reduced costs associated with program changes made to our free membership offering,\nand an improved gross profit rate from our Health initiatives.\nOur gross profit rate increased in the first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to improved financial performance from our membership offerings, which\nincluded higher services margin rates and reduced costs associated with program changes made to our free membership offering, favorable product margin\nrates, the profit-sharing revenue from our private label and co-branded credit card arrangement and an improved gross profit rate from our Health initiatives.\nOur profit-sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement has been a consistent benefit to our gross profit and operating income rates for the past nine\nquarters and approximated 1.4% of Domestic revenue in fiscal 2023, an increase of approximately 50 basis points compared to fiscal 2020. This growth has\nbeen driven by the increased usage of our credit card, both at and outside of Best Buy, and the favorable credit environment. For fiscal 2024, we expect this\nprofit-sharing revenue to have a relatively neutral impact to our annual gross profit rate compared to last year, as the benefit from the first half of the year is\nexpected to turn to a slight pressure in the second half of the year.\nOur SG&A in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was approximately flat to last year, as higher incentive compensation was primarily offset by lower store payroll\nexpense.\nOur SG&A in the first six months of fiscal 2024 decreased primarily due to lower store payroll expense, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense.\nThe reduction in restructuring charges in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024 was primarily related to higher-than-expected employee retention\nfrom our fiscal 2023 resource optimization initiative. Refer to Note 2, Restructuring, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\nOur operating income rate increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, due to an increase in gross profit rate and lower restructuring charges, partially offset\nby an unfavorable SG&A rate.\nOur operating income rate decreased in the six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to decreased leverage from lower sales volume on our fixed expenses and\nhigher incentive compensation expense, which resulted in an unfavorable SG&A rate, partially offset by favorability in gross profit rate.\nInternational Segment\nSelected financial data for the International segment was as follows ($ in millions):\nRevenue\nRevenue % change\nComparable sales % change\nGross profit\nGross profit as a % of revenue\nSG&A\nSG&A as a % of revenue\nRestructuring charges\nOperating income\nOperating income as a % of revenue\nThree Months Ended\nJuly 29, 2023\nJuly 30, 2022\n$\n693\n(8.8)%\n$\n760\n$\n(9.3)%\nSix Months Ended\nJuly 29, 2023\n1,359\n(10.2)%\nJuly 30, 2022\n$\n1,513\n(7.4)%\n(5.4)%\n(4.2)%\n(5.5)%\n(2.8)%\n$\n168\n$\n178\n$\n326\n$\n361\n24.2 %\n23.4 %\n24.0%\n23.9 %\n$\n149\n$\n150\n$\n287\n$\n299\n21.5 %\n19.7 %\n21.1 %\n19.8 %\n$\n$\n$\n(1)\n$\n1\n$\n19\n$\n28\n$\n40\n$\n61\n2.7 %\n3.7 %\n2.9%\n4.0%\nThe decreases in revenue in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024 were primarily driven by comparable sales declines of 5.4% and 5.5%,\nrespectively, and the negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.\n18\n\nAnswer:", "target": "The entertainment segment experienced the highest growth of 9% during Q2 FY2024, primarily from gaming division.", "url": "https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000764478/5e179976-086d-4c3c-af0c-85fda4b35b9d.pdf", "pages": [18]}

Question: As of FY 2021, how much did Verizon expect to pay for its retirees in 2024?\nDocument Pages Context:\nPage 63:\nfor assets and liabilities. We record these translation adjustments in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of Equity,\nin our consolidated balance sheets. We record exchange gains and losses resulting from the conversion of transaction currency to functional\ncurrency as a component of Other income (expense), net.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nPension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefits earned during the year, as well as interest on projected benefit obligations,\nare accrued. Prior service costs and credits resulting from changes in plan benefits are generally amortized over the average remaining service\nperiod of the employees expected to receive benefits. Expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the return on assets\nassumption to the actual fair value of plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in Other income (expense), net in the year in\nwhich they occur. These gains and losses are measured annually as of December 31 or upon a remeasurement event. Verizon management\nemployees no longer earn pension benefits or earn service towards the Company retiree medical subsidy. See Note 11 for additional\ninformation.\nWe recognize a pension or a postretirement plan's funded status as either an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets. Also, we\nmeasure any unrecognized prior service costs and credits that arise during the period as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive\nincome, net of applicable income tax.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nWe employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency swaps, forward\nstarting interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, interest rate caps and foreign exchange forwards. We do not hold\nderivatives for trading purposes.\nWe measure all derivatives at fair value and recognize them as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Our derivative\ninstruments are valued primarily using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substantial terms of our derivative\ncontracts and thus are classified as Level 2. Changes in the fair values of derivative instruments applied as economic hedges are recognized in\nearnings in the current period. For fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is recognized in earnings, along\nwith the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is\nreported in Other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized in earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. For net\ninvestment hedges of certain of our foreign operations, the change in the fair value of the hedging instruments is reported in Other\ncomprehensive income (loss) as part of the cumulative translation adjustment and partially offsets the impact of foreign currency changes on\nthe value of our net investment.\nCash flows from derivatives, which are designated as accounting hedges or applied as economic hedges, are presented consistently with the\ncash flow classification of the related hedged items. See Note 9 for additional information.\nVariable Interest Entities\nVIES are entities that lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from\nother parties, have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity's operations through voting\nrights, do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. We\nconsolidate the assets and liabilities of VIEs when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the party that has\nthe power to make the decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or\nthe right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\n63\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\nPage 94:\nfair value is measured using the NAV per share as a practical expedient are not leveled within the fair value hierarchy but are included in total\ninvestments.\nEmployer Contributions\nIn 2021, we made no discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plans, $58 million of contributions to our nonqualified pension plans\nand $885 million of contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans.

{"context": "Answer the following question very briefly using scanned text from pages. No explanation needed. Question: Does 3M maintain a stable trend of dividend distribution?\nDocument Pages Context:\nPage 62:\nTable of Contents\nFinancial condition:\nRefer to the section entitled Financial Condition and Liquidity later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows.\nIn November 2018, 3M's Board of Directors replaced the Company's February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. This new program authorizes the\nrepurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M's outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In the first six months of 2023, the Company purchased $29 million of its\nown stock, compared to $773 million of stock purchases in the first six months of 2022. As of June 30, 2023, approximately $4.2 billion remained available under the\nauthorization. In February 2023, 3M's Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share, an increase of 1 percent. This marked the 65th consecutive\nyear of dividend increases for 3M. In May 2023, 3M's Board of Directors declared a second-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales:\nRefer to the preceding Overview section and the Performance by Business Segment section later in MD&A for additional discussion of sales change.\nOperating Expenses:\n(Percent of net sales)\nCost of sales\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A)\nResearch, development and related expenses (R&D)\nOperating income (loss) margin\n2023\nThree months ended\nJune 30,\n2022\nChange\n2023\nSix months ended\nJune 30,\n2022\nChange\n55.3%\n146.6\n58.5%\n(3.2)%\n34.7\n111.9\n56.4 %\n85.0\n5.7\n(107.6)%\n5.5\n0.2\n5.8\n1.3%\n(108.9)%\n(47.2)%\n56.6%\n27.9\n5.5\n10.0%\n(0.2)%\n57.1\n0.3\n(57.2)%\nStock compensation expense was $41 million and $47 million for the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was $176 million and $182 million for the six months\nended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which impacts cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A); and research, development and related expenses\n(R&D). The Company's annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in February. Accounting rules require recognition of expense under a non-substantive\nvesting period approach, requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. This retiree-eligible population represents 35 percent of the annual\ngrant stock-based compensation expense; therefore, higher stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the first quarter each year.\n3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense in 2023 to decrease by approximately $160 million pre-tax when compared to 2022, which\nimpacts cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D. The year-on-year decrease in defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense for the second quarter and first six\nmonths of 2023 was approximately $38 million and $80 million, respectively.\nFor total year 2022, the Company recognized consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement service cost expense of $426 million and a benefit of $248\nmillion related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) for a total consolidated\ndefined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $178 million.\nFor total year 2023, defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately $270 million while non-service pension and\npostretirement net benefit cost is anticipated to be a benefit of approximately $125 million, for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense\nof approximately $145 million, a decrease in expense of approximately $30 million compared to 2022.\nThe Company is continuing the ongoing deployment of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, with these investments impacting cost of sales,\nSG&A, and R&D.\nCost of Sales:\nCost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 when compared to the same period last year. Decreases were\nprimarily due to lower year-on-year net costs for significant litigation to address certain PFAS-related matters at 3M's Zwijndrecht, Belgium site, higher selling prices, spending\ndiscipline and restructuring benefits. These decreases were partially offset by higher raw materials and energy costs; manufacturing productivity headwinds; investments in\ngrowth, productivity and sustainability; and restructuring charges.\n62\n\nAnswer:", "target": "Yes, not only they distribute the dividends on a routine basis, 3M has also been increasing the per share dividend for consecutive 65 years", "url": "https://investors.3m.com/financials/sec-filings/content/0000066740-23-000058/0000066740-23-000058.pdf", "pages": [62]}

Increases were primarily due to 2022 special item costs for\nsignificant litigation from additional commitments to address PFAS-related matters at 3M's Zwijndrecht, Belgium site (discussed in Note 16), higher raw materials and logistics\ncosts, manufacturing productivity headwinds which were further magnified by the shutdown of certain operations in Belgium and progress on restarting previously-idled\noperations, and investments in growth, productivity and sustainability. On a percent of sales basis, these increases were partially offset by increases in selling prices.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\nSG&A, measured as a percent of sales, increased in 2022 when compared to the same period last year. SG&A was impacted by increased special item costs for significant\nlitigation primarily related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation (discussed in Note 16) resulting in a 2022 second quarter pre-tax charge of approximately\n$1.2 billion, certain impairment costs related to exiting PFAS manufacturing (see Note 15), costs related to exiting Russia (see Note 15), divestiture-related restructuring\ncharges (see Note 5), and continued investment in key growth initiatives. These increases were partially offset by restructuring benefits and ongoing general 3M cost\nmanagement.\nResearch, Development and Related Expenses:\nR&D, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in 2022 when compared to the same period last year. 3M continues to invest in a range of R&D activities from application\ndevelopment, product and manufacturing support, product development and technology development aimed at disruptive innovations.\nGain on Business Divestitures:\nIn the third quarter of 2022, 3M recorded a pre-tax gain of $2.7 billion ($2.7 billion after tax) related to the split-off and combination of its Food Safety business with Neogen\nCorporation. Refer to Note 3 for further details.\nGoodwill Impairment Expense:\nAs a result of 3M's commitment to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing, 3M recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to the Advanced\nMaterials reporting unit (within the Transportation and Electronics business).

{"context": "Answer the following question very briefly using scanned text from pages. No explanation needed. Question: Was American Express able to retain card members during 2022?\nDocument Pages Context:\nPage 45:\nTable of Contents\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nOur results for the year demonstrate that our growth strategy is working and our business is in an even stronger position today than before the pandemic.\nSpending on our network reached record levels, and credit metrics remain below pre-pandemic levels. Our investments in product innovation, technology,\npeople and our brand has led to increased generational relevance with Millennial and Gen Z customers, record new card acquisitions, deeper relationships with\ncustomers and expanded merchant acceptance.\nFor 2022, we reported net income of $7.5 billion, or $9.85 per share, compared with net income of $8.1 billion, or $10.02 per share, a year ago. The reduction\nin net income reflected credit reserve builds and net losses in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the current year compared with sizeable\ncredit reserve releases and significant net gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the prior year.\nWorldwide network volumes for the year increased 21 percent compared to the prior year (24 percent on an FX-adjusted basis\u00b9). Billed business, which\nrepresented 86 percent of our total network volumes and is the most significant driver of our financial results, increased 23 percent year-over-year (25 percent\non an FX-adjusted basis\u00b9), demonstrating our continued ability to acquire, engage and retain high-spending, premium Card Members. U.S. Consumer billed\nbusiness grew by 24 percent year-over-year, reflecting continued strength in spending trends from our premium U.S. consumer Card Members. Billed business\nin our Commercial Services segment grew by 21 percent on a year-over-year basis, reflecting continued growth from U.S. small and mid-sized enterprise\ncustomers, as well as continued steady recovery in spending by our U.S. large and global corporate clients. International billed business grew by 23 percent\nyear-over-year (36 percent on an FX-adjusted basis\u00b9), driven by a strong recovery in spend across both consumer and commercial customers. T&E spending\nmomentum remained strong throughout the year, while year-over-year Goods & Services spending growth slowed towards the end of the year following the\nlarge pandemic recovery growth rates experienced earlier in the year. Inflation was a modest contributor to our strong billed business growth, while the\ncontinuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to the prior year, against most major currencies in which we operate, had a negative impact on our\ninternational billings.\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased 25 percent year-over-year (27 percent on an FX-adjusted basis\u00b9), reflecting strong growth in all our revenue\nlines. Discount revenue, our largest revenue line, increased 25 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by the momentum in our Card Member spending\nvolumes throughout 2022. Net card fees increased 17 percent year over-year, as new card acquisitions reached record levels in 2022 and Card Member\nretention remained high, demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions. Service fees and other revenues increased\n36 percent year-over-year, driven in part by higher travel-related revenues. Net interest income increased 28 percent versus the prior year, primarily driven by\ngrowth in Card Member loans. While the rising interest rate environment had a fairly neutral impact on our results for the full year, rising rates did have a\nmodest negative impact on net interest income towards the end of the year.\nCard Member loans increased 22 percent year-over-year, with the majority of growth coming from existing Card Members and was driven by ongoing strong\ngrowth in billed business, which began to moderate towards the end of the year as we lapped the steep phase of recovery. Provisions for credit losses increased\nversus the prior year, reflecting a reserve build of $617 million compared with a reserve release of $2.5 billion in the prior year, and are expected to increase in\n2023. While delinquency and net write-off rates continued to increase throughout the year, these metrics remain strong, supported by the premium nature of our\ncustomer base, our risk management capabilities and risk actions we took throughout the\nyear.\n1 The foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign\nexchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding prior year period against which such results are being compared). FX-adjusted revenues is a non GAAP\nmeasure. We believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period\nwithout the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\n42\n\nAnswer:", "target": "Yes", "url": "https://s26.q4cdn.com/747928648/files/doc_financials/2022/q4/AMEX-10K-4Q22.pdf", "pages": [45]}

Question: How much does Pfizer expect to pay to spin off Upjohn in the future in USD million?\nDocument Pages Context:\nPage 41:\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nGENERAL\nThe following MD&A is intended to assist the reader in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts\nand certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources, and is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.\nReferences to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate\nchanges are part of our business, they are not within our control and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting\noperational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.\nOVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK\nOur Business and Strategy-Pfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies\nto people that extend and significantly improve their lives. In 2023, we are making additional investments in both R&D and SI&A to support Pfizer's near- and\nlonger-term growth plans, including to support anticipated new launches, commercial launch of COVID-19 products, potential pipeline programs and recently\nacquired assets. We manage our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and Business Innovation.\nBiopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 13A.\nWe expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which approximately 90% has been incurred since inception\nand through the second quarter of 2023. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps through our Transforming to a More Focused Company restructuring program to optimize our end-to-end\nR&D operations to reduce costs and cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&D portfolio in areas where our capabilities are differentiated\nwhile increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding and productive biotech sector. See Note 3. For a description of savings related to this\nprogram, see the Costs and Expenses-Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\nsection within MD&A.\nIn July 2023, we announced that in consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, we are reorganizing\nhow our R&D operations are conducted. Beginning in July 2023, discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for oncology will be performed by a\nnew end-to-end Oncology Research and Development platform function and discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for all remaining\ntherapeutic areas will be consolidated in the Pfizer Research and Development platform function.\nFor additional information about our business, strategy and operating environment, see the Item 1. Business section and Overview of Our Performance,\nOperating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&A of our 2022 Form 10-K.\nOur Business Development Initiatives-We are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product\npipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. Our significant recent business\ndevelopment activities include the transactions discussed in Notes 14 and 2, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, as well as the following:\nProposed Divestiture of Early-Stage Rare Disease Gene Therapy Portfolio-In July 2023, we entered into an agreement with Alexion, a subsidiary of\nAstraZeneca plc, under which Alexion will purchase and license the assets of our early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio. This agreement is consistent\nwith our previously announced strategy to pivot from viral capsid-based gene therapy approaches to harnessing new platform technologies that we believe can\nhave a transformative impact on patients, such as mRNA or in vivo gene editing. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will pay us total consideration of\nup to $1 billion, plus tiered royalties based on annual net sales of the assets. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023, subject to\ncustomary closing conditions.\nAgreement with Flagship Pioneering, Inc. (Flagship)-In July 2023, we and Flagship announced that we have partnered to create a new pipeline of innovative\nmedicines. Under the terms of the novel agreement, we and Flagship will each invest $50 million upfront to explore opportunities to develop 10 single-asset\nprograms by leveraging Flagship's ecosystem of more than 40 human health companies and multiple biotechnology platforms. Pfizer will fund and have an\noption to acquire each selected development program. Flagship and its bioplatform companies will be eligible to receive up to $700 million in milestones and\nroyalties for each successfully commercialized program.\n38\n\nAnswer:", "target": "77.78", "url": "https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000078003/c7518e4a-3aaf-4987-ae85-27460d0f526c.pdf", "pages": [41]}

{"context": "Answer the following question very briefly using scanned text from pages. No explanation needed. Question: Is Verizon a capital intensive business based on FY 2022 data?\nDocument Pages Context:\nPage 23:\nbenefit related costs and interest and financing expenses. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested\nbusinesses, including Verizon Media Group (Verizon Media) divested in September 2021, and other adjustments and gains and\nlosses that are not allocated in assessing segment performance due to their nature. Although such transactions are excluded\nfrom the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses from these\ntransactions that are not individually significant are included in segment results as these items are included in the chief operating\ndecision maker's assessment of segment performance. See \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" for additional information\nregarding Corporate and other results.\nCapital Expenditures and Investments\nWe continue to invest in our wireless networks, high-speed fiber and other advanced technologies to position ourselves at the\ncenter of growth trends for the future. During the year ended December 31, 2022, these investments included $23.1 billion for\ncapital expenditures, inclusive of approximately $6.2 billion in C-Band related capital expenditures. See \"Cash Flows Used in\nInvesting Activities\" and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information. We believe that our investments aimed at\nexpanding our portfolio of products and services will provide our customers with an efficient, reliable infrastructure for competing\nin the information economy.\nGlobal Network and Technology\nWe are focusing our capital spending on adding capacity and density to our 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network, while also\nbuilding our next generation 5G network. We are densifying our networks by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions\nand distributed antenna systems. Network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video\nconsumption and the growing demand for loT products and services on our 4G LTE and 5G networks. Over the past several\nyears, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and\nmobile 5G wireless services. 5G technology enables higher throughput and lower latency than the 4G LTE technology and allows\nour networks to handle more traffic as the number of internet-connected devices grows. In January 2022, we began deploying C-\nBand spectrum, which has been built out to cover approximately 189 million POPS in the U.S. as of December 31, 2022. We\nexpect to continue deploying C-Band spectrum across the continental U.S. as more and more of the spectrum becomes\navailable for our use. We use low and mid-band spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology, to allow 5G service\nto run simultaneously with 4G LTE on multiple spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizon's\nmillimeter wave and C-Band coverage areas, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G technology using the lower spectrum\nbands where this network is available. This allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve\nboth 4G and 5G customers.\nTo compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copper-based products, we continue to build fiber-based networks\nsupporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing.\nWe are transforming the architecture of our networks into our Intelligent Edge Network, providing improved efficiency and\nvirtualization, increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support our fiber-based and radio\naccess network technologies. We expect that this new architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network\nelements, speed the deployment of 5G wireless technology and create new opportunities in the business market in a cost-\nefficient manner.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nIn this section, we discuss our overall results of operations and highlight special items that are not included in our segment\nresults.

{"context": "Answer the following question very briefly using scanned text from pages. No explanation needed. Question: Is Boeing's business subject to cyclicality?\nDocument Pages Context:\nPage 8:\nTable of Contents\nForward-looking statements are based on expectations and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when made, but that may not prove to\nbe accurate. These statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that are difficult to\npredict. Many factors, including those set forth in the \u201cRisk Factors\" section below and other important factors disclosed in this report and from\ntime to time in our other filings with the SEC, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements.\nAny forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-\nlooking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ\nmaterially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating\nthe information contained in this report.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe depend heavily on commercial airlines, subjecting us to unique risks.\nMarket conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related services. The commercial aircraft market is\npredominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are\nsustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further\ninfluenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological\nadvances, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, pandemics, epidemics and environmental regulations. Historically, the\nairline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost\ncompetitive. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of\nour major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual\norders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In\naddition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these\nmacroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.\nWe enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses, which could subject us to losses if we have cost\noverruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years\nbefore the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing\ngenerally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our\nrevenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of\nour control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues\nand operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will\nexercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions,\nairline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and\nlimit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.\n6\n\nAnswer:", "target": "Yes, Boeing's business is subject to cyclicality due to its exposure to the airline industry which is a cyclical industry.", "url": "https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000012927/c93682a4-8b3c-4251-a2ed-97c4e474a214.pdf", "pages": [8]}

{"context": "Answer the following question very briefly using scanned text from pages. No explanation needed. Question: Who are the primary customers of Boeing as of FY2022?\nDocument Pages Context:\nPage 8:\nTable of Contents\nForward-looking statements are based on expectations and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when made, but that may not prove to\nbe accurate. These statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that are difficult to\npredict. Many factors, including those set forth in the \u201cRisk Factors\" section below and other important factors disclosed in this report and from\ntime to time in our other filings with the SEC, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements.\nAny forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-\nlooking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ\nmaterially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating\nthe information contained in this report.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe depend heavily on commercial airlines, subjecting us to unique risks.\nMarket conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related services. The commercial aircraft market is\npredominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are\nsustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further\ninfluenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological\nadvances, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, pandemics, epidemics and environmental regulations. Historically, the\nairline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost\ncompetitive. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of\nour major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual\norders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In\naddition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these\nmacroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.\nWe enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses, which could subject us to losses if we have cost\noverruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years\nbefore the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing\ngenerally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our\nrevenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of\nour control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues\nand operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will\nexercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions,\nairline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and\nlimit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.\n6\n\nPage 10:\nTable of Contents\ncommercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or create significant disruption to our production system, or if our suppliers cannot timely\ndeliver components to us at the cost and rates necessary to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and/or the\nfinancial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer.\nOperational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft programs could result in additional production\ndelays and/or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft, either of which would negatively impact our revenues and operating margins.\nOur commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure\nto meet internal performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory approval, could result in additional out-of-sequence work\nand increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet\nsupport costs. We and our suppliers are experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of the lingering impacts of COVID-19, global supply\nchain constraints, and labor instability. We and our suppliers are also experiencing inflationary pressures. We continue to monitor the health and\nstability of the supply chain as we ramp up production. These factors have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial\nposition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our commercial aircraft fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements and/or potentially required sustainability standards, we could\nface additional costs and/or lower revenues. Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and\nreliability standards and/or potentially required sustainability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, can be costly\nand technologically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of any Boeing aircraft to\nsatisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues.\nChanges in levels of U.S. government defense spending or acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial position and\nresults of operations.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with the United States\nDepartment of Defense (U.S. DoD). Levels of U.S. defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such\nas the evolving nature of the national security threat environment, U.S. national security strategy, U.S. foreign policy, the domestic political\nenvironment, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation such as authorization and\nappropriations bills.\nThe timeliness of FY24 and future appropriations for government departments and agencies remains a recurrent risk. A lapse in appropriations\nfor government departments or agencies would result in a full or partial government shutdown, which could impact the Company's operations.\nAlternatively, Congress may fund government departments and agencies with one or more Continuing Resolutions; however, this would restrict\nthe execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions. In addition, long-term uncertainty remains with respect to\noverall levels of defense spending in FY24 and beyond. U.S. government discretionary spending, including defense spending, is likely to\ncontinue to be subject to pressure.\nThere continues to be uncertainty with respect to future acquisition priorities and program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other\ngovernment agencies (including NASA), including changes to national security and defense priorities, and tension between modernization\ninvestments, sustainment investments, and investments in new technologies or emergent capabilities. Future investment priority changes or\nbudget cuts, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or\ndelays of existing contracts or programs, or future program opportunities. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the\nCompany's financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n8\n\nPage 14:\nTable of Contents\nguarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or\nfinancial position. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there\nis no assurance that these transactions will be successful. We also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. These transactions may\nresult in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the\ntransaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations,\nhigher costs or asset write-downs.\nRisks Related to Our Contracts\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks.\nIn 2022, 40% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include FMS through the U.S. government. Business\nconducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks.\nOur sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and changes to those regulations could increase our costs.\nNew procurement regulations or climate or cyber-related contractual disclosures, or changes to existing requirements, could increase our\ncompliance costs or otherwise have a material impact on the operating margins of our BDS and BGS businesses. These requirements may also\nresult in withheld payments and/or reduced future business if we fail to comply. For example, proposals to raise domestic content thresholds for\nour U.S. government contracts could have negative impacts on our business. Compliance costs attributable to current and potential future\nprocurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nThe U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail or\nterminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. In\naddition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations\nprocess due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to\nongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as\n\u201ccontinuing resolutions\" rather than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and/or modification,\ncurtailment or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations\nand/or cash flows.\nWe are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under U.S.\ngovernment contracts. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency,\nroutinely audit government contractors. These agencies review our performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable\nlaws, regulations and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found\nto be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must\nbe refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business.\nFurthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and\nadministrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment\nfrom doing business with the U.S. government. We also\n12\n\nAnswer:", "target": "Boeing's primary customers as of FY2022 are a limited number of commercial airlines and the US government.

{"context": "Answer the following question very briefly using scanned text from pages. No explanation needed. Question: What production rate changes is Boeing forecasting for FY2023?\nDocument Pages Context:\nPage 9:\nTable of Contents\nAirlines also are experiencing increased fuel and other costs, and the global economy is experiencing high inflation.\nOur Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, ensure every airplane in our\nproduction system conforms to our exacting specifications, achieve planned production rate targets, successfully develop and certify\nnew aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards.\nThe commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with U.S and non-U.S. suppliers, highly-\nskilled labor performed by thousands of employees of ours and other partners, and stringent and evolving regulatory requirements and\nperformance and reliability standards. The FAA has been working to implement safety reforms such as the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act and\nthe 2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act (ACSAA). One of these, section 116 of the ACSAA prohibited the FAA from issuing a\ntype certificate to aircraft after December 27, 2022 unless the aircraft's flight crew alerting system met certain specifications. The Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, 2023 amended Section 116 of the ACSAA, such that applications for original or amended type certifications that were\nsubmitted to the FAA prior to December 27, 2020, including those of the 737-7 and 737-10, are no longer subject to the crew alerting\nspecifications of Section 116. Additionally, beginning one year after the FAA issues the type certificate for the 737-10, any new 737 MAX aircraft\nmust include certain safety enhancements to be issued an original airworthiness certification by the FAA. These enhancements are included in\nBoeing's application for the certification for the 737-10, and the sufficiency of these enhancements will be determined by the FAA. Beginning\nthree years after the issuance of a type certificate for the 737-10, all previously delivered 737 MAX aircraft must be retrofitted with these safety\nenhancements. As the holder of the type certificate, Boeing is required to bear any costs of these safety enhancement retrofits. We have\nprovisioned for the estimated costs associated with the safety enhancements and do not expect those costs to be material. If we experience\ndelays in achieving certification and/or incorporating safety enhancements, future revenues, cash flows and results of operations could be\nadversely impacted. Comparable agencies in other countries may adopt similar changes. To the extent the FAA or similar regulatory agencies\noutside the U.S. implement more stringent regulations, we may incur additional compliance costs. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft\nprograms and/or derivatives, such as the 777X, 737-7 and 737-10, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing,\ncertification and production schedules.\nIn addition, we have experienced production quality issues, including in our supply chain, which have contributed to lower 787 deliveries,\nincluding a suspension of 787 deliveries from May 2021 to August 2022. We continue to conduct inspections and rework on built and stored 787\naircraft. A number of our customers have contractual remedies, including compensation for late deliveries or rights to reject individual airplane\ndeliveries based on delivery delays. Delays on the 737, 777X and 787 programs have resulted in, and may continue to result in, customers\nhaving the right to terminate orders, be compensated for late deliveries and/or substitute orders for other Boeing aircraft.\nWe must minimize disruption caused by production changes, achieve operational stability and implement productivity improvements in order to\nmeet customer demand and maintain our profitability. We have previously announced plans to adjust production rates on several of our\ncommercial aircraft programs. The 787 program is currently producing at low rates and we expect to gradually increase to 5 per month in 2023.\nProduction of the 777X is currently paused and is expected to resume in 2023. The 737 program has experienced operational and supply chain\nchallenges stabilizing production at 31 per month. We plan to gradually increase 737 production rates based on market demand and supply\nchain capacity. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to reduce the costs of building our aircraft, including working with our suppliers to\nreduce supplier costs, identifying and implementing productivity improvements and optimizing how we manage inventory.

Question: As of Q2'2023, is Pfizer spinning off any large business segments?\nDocument Pages Context:\nPage 41:\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nGENERAL\nThe following MD&A is intended to assist the reader in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts\nand certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources, and is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.\nReferences to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate\nchanges are part of our business, they are not within our control and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting\noperational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.\nOVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK\nOur Business and Strategy-Pfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies\nto people that extend and significantly improve their lives. In 2023, we are making additional investments in both R&D and SI&A to support Pfizer's near- and\nlonger-term growth plans, including to support anticipated new launches, commercial launch of COVID-19 products, potential pipeline programs and recently\nacquired assets. We manage our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and Business Innovation.\nBiopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 13A.\nWe expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which approximately 90% has been incurred since inception\nand through the second quarter of 2023. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps through our Transforming to a More Focused Company restructuring program to optimize our end-to-end\nR&D operations to reduce costs and cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&D portfolio in areas where our capabilities are differentiated\nwhile increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding and productive biotech sector. See Note 3. For a description of savings related to this\nprogram, see the Costs and Expenses-Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\nsection within MD&A.\nIn July 2023, we announced that in consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, we are reorganizing\nhow our R&D operations are conducted. Beginning in July 2023, discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for oncology will be performed by a\nnew end-to-end Oncology Research and Development platform function and discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for all remaining\ntherapeutic areas will be consolidated in the Pfizer Research and Development platform function.\nFor additional information about our business, strategy and operating environment, see the Item 1. Business section and Overview of Our Performance,\nOperating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&A of our 2022 Form 10-K.\nOur Business Development Initiatives-We are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product\npipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. Our significant recent business\ndevelopment activities include the transactions discussed in Notes 14 and 2, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, as well as the following:\nProposed Divestiture of Early-Stage Rare Disease Gene Therapy Portfolio-In July 2023, we entered into an agreement with Alexion, a subsidiary of\nAstraZeneca plc, under which Alexion will purchase and license the assets of our early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio. This agreement is consistent\nwith our previously announced strategy to pivot from viral capsid-based gene therapy approaches to harnessing new platform technologies that we believe can\nhave a transformative impact on patients, such as mRNA or in vivo gene editing. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will pay us total consideration of\nup to $1 billion, plus tiered royalties based on annual net sales of the assets. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023, subject to\ncustomary closing conditions.\nAgreement with Flagship Pioneering, Inc. (Flagship)-In July 2023, we and Flagship announced that we have partnered to create a new pipeline of innovative\nmedicines. Under the terms of the novel agreement, we and Flagship will each invest $50 million upfront to explore opportunities to develop 10 single-asset\nprograms by leveraging Flagship's ecosystem of more than 40 human health companies and multiple biotechnology platforms. Pfizer will fund and have an\noption to acquire each selected development program. Flagship and its bioplatform companies will be eligible to receive up to $700 million in milestones and\nroyalties for each successfully commercialized program.\n38\n\nAnswer:", "target": "Yes, it's spinning off Upjohn.", "url": "https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000078003/c7518e4a-3aaf-4987-ae85-27460d0f526c.pdf", "pages": [41]}

This reflects the non-additive nature\nof VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBS, Corporate, and risk types. For maximum and minimum VaR, diversification benefit is not meaningful as\nthe maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components.\n(b) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions\nrevenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value. In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's\ninternal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening\nof the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now\nreflected in other sensitivity-based measures.\n(c) Corporate and other LOB VaR includes a legacy private equity position in Corporate which is publicly traded.\n(d) The increase in CCB VaR is driven by interest rate volatility impacting Home Lending warehouse loans, MSR, and related hedges.\n(e) For the period ended June 30, 2022, maximum Credit Portfolio VaR remained elevated due to the effects of nickel price increases and the associated\nvolatility in the nickel market which occurred during the first quarter of 2022.\nQuarter over quarter results\nAverage total VaR was flat for the three months ended\nJune 30, 2023, when compared with March 31, 2023,\nreflecting increases in fixed income offset by market volatility\nrelating to commodities rolling out of the one-year historical\nlook-back period.\nYear over year results\nAverage total VaR decreased by $7 million for the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2023, compared with the same\nperiod in the prior year predominantly driven by risk\nreductions impacting Credit Portfolio VaR as well as fixed\nincome.\nThe following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the five trailing quarters.\nDaily Risk Management VaR\n$ millions\n100\n50\n0\nSecond Quarter\n2022\nThird Quarter\n2022\nFourth Quarter\n2022\nFirst Quarter\n2023\nSecond Quarter\n2023\n85\n\nAnswer:", "target": "Yes.

Question: What is the quantity of restructuring costs directly outlined in Pepsico's income statements for FY2022? If restructuring costs are not explicitly outlined then state 0.\nDocument Pages Context:\nPage 78:\nTable of Contents\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Not Yet Adopted\nIn September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to enhance the transparency of supplier\nfinance programs to allow financial statement users to understand the effect on working capital, liquidity and cash flows. The\nnew guidance requires disclosure of key terms of the program, including a description of the payment terms, payment timing and\nassets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees provided to the finance provider or intermediary. Other requirements\ninclude the disclosure of the amount that remains unpaid as of the end of the reporting period, a description of where these\nobligations are presented in the balance sheet and a rollforward of the obligation during the annual period. The guidance is\neffective in the first quarter of 2023, except for the rollforward, which is effective in 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We will\nadopt the guidance when effective.\nNote 3 \u2015 Restructuring and Impairment Charges\n2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan\nWe publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage new\ntechnology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and\ninformation systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our\nmanufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in the fourth\nquarter of 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within\nthe initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.65 billion, including cash\nexpenditures of approximately $2.9 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 55% of severance and\nother employee-related costs, 10% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions and 35%\nfor other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives.\nThe total plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows:\nFLNA\nQFNA\nPBNA\nLatAm\nEurope\nAMESA\nAPAC\nCorporate\nExpected pre-tax charges\n15%\n1%\n25 %\n10 %\n25 %\n5 %\n4 %\n15%\nA summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan charges is as follows:\n2022\n2021\n2020\nCost of sales\n$\n33\n$\n29\n$\n30\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n347\n208\n239\nOther pension and retiree medical benefits expense\n31\n10\n20\nTotal restructuring and impairment charges\n$\n411\n$\n247\n$\n289\nAfter-tax amount\n$\n334\n$\n206 $\n231\nImpact on net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share\n$\n(0.24) $\n(0.15) $\n(0.17)\n76\n\nAnswer:", "target": "Pepsico's restructuring costs in FY2022 amounted to $411 million .", "url": "https://pepsico.gcs-web.com/static-files/d051bdd6-c6d2-4814-826f-ece589b88d4c", "pages": [78]}
