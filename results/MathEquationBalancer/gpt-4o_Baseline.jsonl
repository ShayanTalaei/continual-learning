Perform the multiplication first:  \n   18 * 12 = 216  \n   So, the equation becomes:  \n   23 - 216 + 8 - 13  \n\n2. Perform the subtraction and addition from left to right:  \n   23 - 216 = -193  \n   -193 + 8 = -185  \n   -185 - 13 = -133  \n\nThis satisfies the equation.\n\n### Final Answer:\nFINAL ANSWER:\n<answer>\n23 - 18 * 12 + 8 - 13 = -133\n</answer>"}

Perform the division first:  \n   \\( 18 / 4 = 4.5 \\)  \n\n2. Substitute back into the equation:  \n   \\( 9 - 10 + 4.5 - 12 \\)  \n\n3. Perform the operations from left to right:  \n   \\( 9 - 10 = -1 \\)  \n   \\( -1 + 4.5 = 3.5 \\)  \n   \\( 3.5 - 12 = -3 \\)  \n\nThe equation is correct.\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\n<answer>\n9 - 10 + 18 / 4 - 12 = -3\n</answer>"}
