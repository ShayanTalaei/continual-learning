For a flat plate, we can use empirical correlations:\n   - First find Reynolds number (Re)\n   - Then find Nusselt number (Nu)\n   - Finally calculate h\n\nLet's solve step by step:\n\n1. Properties of air at film temperature (Tf = (180 + 110)/2 = 145\u00b0F = 603\u00b0R):\n   - \u03bd (kinematic viscosity) \u2248 0.000185 ft\u00b2/s\n   - k (thermal conductivity) \u2248 0.0165 Btu/(hr\u00b7ft\u00b7\u00b0F)\n   - Pr (Prandtl number) \u2248 0.707\n\n2. Reynolds number:\n   Re = (V \u00d7 L)/\u03bd\n   Re = (190 \u00d7 0.292)/0.000185\n   Re = 300,540 (turbulent flow)\n\n3. Average Nusselt number for turbulent flow:\n   Nu = 0.037 \u00d7 Re\u2070\u00b7\u2078 \u00d7 Pr\u00b9/\u00b3\n   Nu = 0.037 \u00d7 (300,540)\u2070\u00b7\u2078 \u00d7 (0.707)\u00b9/\u00b3\n   Nu \u2248 577\n\n4. Average convection coefficient:\n   h = (Nu \u00d7 k)/L\n   h = (577 \u00d7 0.0165)/0.292\n   h \u2248 32.6 Btu/(hr\u00b7ft\u00b2\u00b7\u00b0F)\n\n5. Heat flux:\n   q\" = h \u00d7 (T\u221e - Ts)\n   q\" = 32.6 \u00d7 (180 - 110)\n   q\" = 32.6 \u00d7 70\n   q\" \u2248 2,282 Btu/(hr\u00b7ft\u00b2)\n\nLooking at the options, this value is closest to 2200 Btu/hr-ft\u00b2.\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\n<answer>\n(D)\n</answer>"}

Each task will include:\n1. A specific question or problem to solve\n2. A cheatsheet containing relevant strategies, patterns, and examples from similar problems\n\n---\n\n## 1. ANALYSIS & STRATEGY\n\n- Carefully analyze both the question and cheatsheet before starting\n- Search for and identify any applicable patterns, strategies, or examples within the cheatsheet\n- Create a structured approach to solving the problem at hand\n- Review and document any limitations in the provided reference materials\n\n## 2. SOLUTION DEVELOPMENT\n\n- Present your solution using clear, logical steps that others can follow and review\n- Explain your reasoning and methodology before presenting final conclusions\n- Provide detailed explanations for each step of the process\n- Check and verify all assumptions and intermediate calculations\n\n## 3. PROGRAMMING TASKS\n\nWhen coding is required:\n- Write clean, efficient Python code\n- Follow the strict code formatting and execution protocol (always use the Python code formatting block; furthermore, after the code block, always explicitly request execution by appending: \"EXECUTE CODE!\"):\n  ```python\n  # Your code here\n  ```\n  EXECUTE CODE!\n\n- All required imports and dependencies should be clearly declared at the top of your code\n- Include clear inline comments to explain any complex programming logic\n- Perform result validation after executing your code\n- Apply optimization techniques from the cheatsheet when applicable\n- The code should be completely self-contained without external file dependencies--it should be ready to be executed right away\n- Do not include any placeholders, system-specific paths, or hard-coded local paths\n- Feel free to use standard and widely-used pip packages\n- Opt for alternative methods if errors persist during execution\n- Exclude local paths and engine-specific settings (e.g., avoid configurations like chess.engine.SimpleEngine.popen_uci(\"/usr/bin/stockfish\"))\n\n## 4. FINAL ANSWER FORMAT\n\nALWAYS present your final answer in the following format:\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\n<answer>\n(final answer)\n</answer>\n\nN.B.
